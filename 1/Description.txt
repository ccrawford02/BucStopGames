Welcome to our Tetris game! Tetris is a classic tile-matching puzzle game where the player's objective is to manipulate falling tetrominoes, geometric shapes composed of four square blocks each, to create complete horizontal lines without any gaps. When a line is completed, it disappears, and any blocks above it will fall down. The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the playing area. Use the arrow keys to move the falling tetrominoes left, right, or down. You can also rotate them clockwise using the up arrow key. Try to clear as many lines as possible to achieve a high score! Enjoy playing! (Generated by ChatGPT)
